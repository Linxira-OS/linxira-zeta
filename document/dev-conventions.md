# Dev Conventions

日常编码约定参考：代码质量、中央工具库、Bun 优先、模型策略 KDL、生成文件、日志、TUI 消毒、Rust 构建档位、测试指南、变更日志。硬性合并/发布规则见根 `AGENTS.md`；合并操作手册见 `document/merge-playbook.md`；CI 与发布机制见 `document/release.md`。

## Code Quality

- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- **NEVER use `ReturnType<>`** — use the actual type name.
- **NEVER use inline imports** — no `await import()`, no `import("pkg").Type` in type positions, no dynamic type imports. Always top-level.
- Check `node_modules` for external API types instead of guessing.
- **Barrel exports**: prefer `export * from "./module"` over named re-exports, including `export type { ... } from`. In pure `index.ts` barrels, use star re-exports even for single-specifier cases. If stars create ambiguity, remove the redundant export path; do not keep duplicates.
- **Class privacy**: use ES `#private` fields; leave externally accessible members bare. **No `private`/`protected`/`public` keyword on fields or methods**, except on **constructor parameter properties** where TypeScript requires it (e.g. `constructor(private readonly session: ToolSession)`).
- **Promises**: use `Promise.withResolvers()` instead of `new Promise((resolve, reject) => ...)`.
- **Prompts**: never build prompts in code (no inline strings, template literals, or concatenation). Prompts live in static `.md` files; use Handlebars for dynamic content. Import them via `import content from "./prompt.md" with { type: "text" }` — not `readFile`.
- **Worker scripts**: workers re-enter the CLI entrypoint; never spawn separate worker entry modules. `cli.ts` declares itself as the worker host at startup (`declareWorkerHostEntry()` from `@linxiraos/pi-utils/env`) and dispatches hidden argv selectors (`__omp_worker_stats_sync`, `__omp_worker_tab`, `__omp_worker_js_eval`, `__omp_worker_tiny_inference`) before loading the command registry. Spawn sites use:
  ```ts
  import { workerHostEntry } from "@linxiraos/pi-utils";
  const hostEntry = workerHostEntry();
  const worker = hostEntry
  	? new Worker(hostEntry, { type: "module", argv: ["__omp_worker_<name>"] })
  	: new Worker(new URL("./<worker>.ts", import.meta.url).href, { type: "module" });
  ```
  When the process was started from the zeta CLI — source `cli.ts`, npm-bundle `dist/cli.js`, or compiled binary — `workerHostEntry()` is `Bun.main` and the worker re-enters the single entry module, so no per-worker `--compile` entrypoints or bundle entries exist. Outside a CLI host (`bun test`, SDK embedding, standalone `omp-stats`) it returns `null` and the direct-module fallback loads the worker source. New worker kinds MUST add their selector to the dispatch table in `cli.ts` and keep the fallback branch.
  History: `with { type: "file" }` only copied the entry as a raw asset (workers crashed silently in compiled binaries — issues #1011, #1027), and the later literal-path + extra-entrypoint pattern required keeping spawn literals and two build scripts in sync (issue #1150). The smoke probe below is the live validation of this contract.
  Validate any new worker with the dedicated smoke probe: `zeta --smoke-test` spawns the stats sync worker and the tiny-model subprocess, pings them, and exits — it's wired into `ci:test:smoke` and `scripts/install-tests/run-ci.sh` so binary, source-link, and tarball installs all exercise it. Add a sibling smoke if the new worker is on a different module graph.

## Central Utilities

Before writing a helper, check whether one already exists — `packages/coding-agent/src/utils/`, `@linxiraos/pi-utils`, `@linxiraos/pi-tui`, and the domain modules next to your callsite. This applies to **everything**: VCS wrappers, formatting/truncation/path-display helpers, image handling, clipboard, streams, temp files, caching. The central versions carry hardening a fresh copy always loses (timeouts, output caps, non-interactive env, lock avoidance, caching, TUI sanitization).

- Search first: `grep` for the operation before implementing it. Two implementations of the same thing is a bug even when both work.
- Examples of the pattern: git/jj access goes through the `pi-vcs` native addon (`import * as vcs from "@linxiraos/pi-natives/vcs"`, e.g. `vcs.gitInfo(dir)`, `vcs.git(dir)?.worktreeRemove(path, force)`) — never hand-spawn via `$`/`Bun.spawn`. The old `src/utils/git.ts` / `src/utils/jj.ts` wrappers were removed upstream in v18.0.9; rendering goes through the helpers in TUI Sanitization below (`replaceTabs`, `truncateToWidth`, `shortenPath`, `PREVIEW_LIMITS`) rather than ad-hoc string math.
- Missing capability? Extend the central helper (new option, new sub-function on the namespace) and call it — don't fork its logic locally.

## Bun Over Node

Use Bun APIs where they provide a cleaner alternative; fall back to `node:*` only for what Bun doesn't cover. **Never spawn shell commands for operations with proper APIs** (e.g., don't `Bun.spawnSync(["mkdir", "-p", dir])` — use `mkdirSync`).

### Quick reference

| Operation       | Use                                       | Not                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| File read/write | `Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()`               | `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`    |
| Spawn process   | `` $`cmd` ``, `Bun.spawn()`               | `child_process`                    |
| Sleep           | `Bun.sleep(ms)`                           | `setTimeout` promise               |
| Binary lookup   | `$which("git")` from `@linxiraos/pi-utils` | `spawnSync(["which", "git"])`      |
| HTTP server     | `Bun.serve()`                             | `http.createServer()`              |
| SQLite          | `bun:sqlite`                              | `better-sqlite3`                   |
| Hashing         | `Bun.hash()`, `Bun.password.*`, WebCrypto | `node:crypto`                      |
| Path resolution | `import.meta.dir`, `import.meta.path`     | `fileURLToPath` dance              |
| JSON5           | `Bun.JSON5.parse()` / `.stringify()`      | `json5` package                    |
| JSONL           | `Bun.JSONL.parse()` / `.parseChunk()`     | `text.split("\n").map(JSON.parse)` |
| String width    | `Bun.stringWidth()`                       | `get-east-asian-width`, custom     |
| Text wrapping   | `Bun.wrapAnsi()`                          | custom ANSI-aware wrappers         |

### Process execution

Prefer Bun Shell (`` $`cmd` ``) for simple commands:

```typescript
import { $ } from "bun";

const result = await $`git status`.cwd(dir).quiet().nothrow();
if (result.exitCode === 0) {
	const text = result.text();
}

$`do-stuff ${tmpFile}`.quiet().nothrow(); // fire and forget
```

Methods: `.quiet()`, `.nothrow()`, `.text()`, `.cwd(path)`.

Use `Bun.spawn`/`Bun.spawnSync` only for: long-running processes (LSP, kernels), streaming stdin/stdout/stderr (SSE, JSON-RPC), or process control (signals, kill, complex lifecycle).

When using `pipe` mode, cast the stream:

```typescript
const child = Bun.spawn(["cmd"], { stdout: "pipe", stderr: "pipe" });
const reader = (child.stdout as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>).getReader();
```

### Node module imports

Always use **namespace imports** for `node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:os`:

```typescript
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";
import * as path from "node:path";
import * as os from "node:os";
```

- Async-only file → `node:fs/promises`.
- Needs both sync and async → `node:fs`, then `fs.promises.xxx` for async.

### File I/O

Prefer Bun:

```typescript
const text = await Bun.file(path).text();
const data = await Bun.file(path).json();
await Bun.write(path, data); // auto-creates parent dirs
```

Use `node:fs/promises` for directory ops (`fs.mkdir`, `fs.rm`, `fs.readdir`) — Bun has no native directory APIs. Avoid sync APIs in async flows; use sync only when forced by a synchronous interface.

**Anti-patterns:**

- `existsSync`/`readFileSync`/`writeFileSync` in async code → `Bun.file()` APIs.
- `mkdir(dirname(path), …)` before `Bun.write(path, …)` → redundant; `Bun.write` handles it.
- `if (await file.exists()) { await file.json() }` → two syscalls plus race. Use try-catch with `isEnoent`:
  ```typescript
  import { isEnoent } from "@linxiraos/pi-utils";
  try {
  	return await Bun.file(path).json();
  } catch (err) {
  	if (isEnoent(err)) return null;
  	throw err;
  }
  ```
- Multiple `Bun.file(path)` handles for the same path (including across `checkX`/`loadX` helpers).
- `Buffer.from(await Bun.file(x).arrayBuffer())` → `await fs.readFile(path)`.
- Existence check + try-catch around the same read → drop the existence check.

### Streams

Prefer centralized helpers:

```typescript
import { readStream, readLines } from "./utils/stream";
const text = await readStream(child.stdout);
for await (const line of readLines(stream)) {
	/* ... */
}
```

Manual reader loops only when the protocol requires it (SSE, streaming JSON-RPC).

### Misc

- **Sleep**: `await Bun.sleep(ms)`, never `new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms))`.
- **Password hashing**: `Bun.password.hash(pw, "bcrypt")` / `Bun.password.verify(pw, hash)`.
- **String width**: `Bun.stringWidth(text, { countAnsiEscapeCodes?: false })`.
- **Wrapping**: `Bun.wrapAnsi(text, width, { wordWrap, hard, trim })`.

## Model/Provider Policy Lives in KDL

**NEVER hard-code model- or provider-conditional policy in TypeScript.** No `id.includes("claude")`, no model-name regexes, no per-model lookup tables (effort ladders, pricing, context windows, modalities, API routing, quirk flags). All of it belongs in the KDL rule tree at `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules/`, compiled by `bun run gen:compat` into the committed `rules.json` and resolved at build time via `resolveModelPolicy`/`buildModel`.

Ownership strata (see `src/compat/rules/README.md`):

- `taxonomy/*.kdl` — identity: class membership, families, revision extraction, reviewed overrides, suffix collapse.
- `classes/*.kdl` — model-lineage truths (behavior inherent to a model line, on any host).
- `providers/*.kdl` — deployment contracts (behavior a host imposes), plus documented exact-id residue.
- `runtime/behavior.kdl` — heuristics that run before/outside exact model lookup (`api-routes`, `model-limits`, `exclude-models`, `pricing-peer`, hosted defaults).

Rules for TS code:

- Branching on model identity in TS is allowed **only** through structured facts from `classifyModel()` (`class`/`family`/`revision`/effort facts) — never through string matching on ids, and prefer a KDL axis when one can express the policy.
- Discovery mappers map authoritative upstream fields as reported; seed neutral values only for fields the upstream omits or misreports **and** KDL explicitly owns via a correction axis (`input-modalities`, `cost-patch`, `limits-patch`, `context-window-floor`, thinking axes). Assert rule-owned corrections through `buildModel`; raw discovery specs remain the right assertion surface for parsing/normalization contracts.
- An id that no selector can isolate gets an exact-id `models` residue rule with a comment — never a special case in TS.
- Equal-rank rule overlaps throw `AmbiguousOverlapError` at resolve time; fix with an explicit `priority=` in KDL, not code.
- After editing rules: `bun run gen:compat` and commit `rules.json` alongside the `.kdl` change.

## Generated Files

**NEVER edit `packages/catalog/src/models.json` directly.** It is generated from upstream sources (stencil.so, provider catalog discovery, OpenCode docs) by `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts` and the descriptors/resolvers in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/`. Hand-edits get overwritten on the next regen. The same applies to `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules.json`, compiled from the KDL tree by `bun run gen:compat`.

To change an entry, fix the source:

- **Model/provider policy** (identity, thinking ladders, wire quirks, modality/limit/pricing corrections, API routing, roster exclusions) → the KDL tree in `packages/catalog/src/compat/rules/` (see the section above).
- **Provider catalog entries** (default model, discovery factory/flags) → the `CATALOG_PROVIDERS` table in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/descriptors.ts`.
- **Discovery/request plumbing** (endpoint shapes, auth, response parsing) → the mappers in `packages/catalog/src/provider-models/openai-compat.ts`.
- **Generator wiring** (upstream merges, premium multipliers, post-processing order) → `packages/catalog/scripts/generate-models.ts`.

Regenerate with `bun run gen:compat` and/or `bun run gen:models` and commit the generated files alongside the source change. Add a regression test against the **rule/descriptor/mapper**, not the bundled JSON, so it survives upstream metadata shifts.

## Logging and CLI Output

Code that may run while the TUI, RPC, SDK, workers, or background runtimes are active MUST NOT use `console.log`/`error`/`warn`; it corrupts rendering or protocols. Use the centralized logger:

```typescript
import { logger } from "@linxiraos/pi-utils";

logger.error("MCP request failed", { url, method });
logger.warn("Theme file invalid, using fallback", { path });
logger.debug("LSP fallback triggered", { reason });
```

Logs go to `~/.zeta/logs/zeta.<date>.<pid>.log`（按日轮转）. Standalone CLI commands that exit without entering the TUI MAY use `console.*` or process streams for intentional user-facing output. Keep structured stdout clean. This exception is semantic, not filename-based; shared code must use `logger` or an explicit output sink.

## TUI Sanitization

All text displayed in tool renderers must be sanitized. Raw content (file contents, error messages, tool output) breaks terminal rendering: tabs → visual holes, long lines → overflow, paths → leak home directory.

**Rules:**

- **Tabs → spaces** via `replaceTabs()` (from `@linxiraos/pi-tui` or `../tools/render-utils`).
- **Truncate** lines with `truncateToWidth()` / `ui.truncate()`. Use `TRUNCATE_LENGTHS` constants.
- **Shorten paths** with `shortenPath()` (replaces home with `~`).
- **Preview limits** from `PREVIEW_LIMITS`. No ad-hoc numbers.

**Apply to every render path**, not just the happy one:

- Success output (file previews, command output, search results).
- **Error messages** — these often embed file content (e.g., patch failure messages include unmatched lines). If a message contains file content, it needs `replaceTabs()`.
- Diff content (added and removed).
- Streaming previews.

### Streaming tool previews

Tool-call previews can have **multiple render paths**. If you add preview-only fields or depend on partially streamed args, update every path — not only the final renderer. Streamed argument buffers decode into display args via `decodeStreamedToolArgs` / `ToolArgsRevealController` (`modes/controllers/tool-args-reveal.ts`); both the live event path and transcript rebuilds must go through them — never spread provider-parsed `arguments` next to a raw `__partialJson` (parsed args lag the stream by a throttled parse window).

For the bash tool specifically:

- The pending preview may need raw `partialJson`, not just parsed `arguments`. Parsed args lag until a JSON object closes, which makes inline env assignments appear only at the end.
- Preserve preview-only fields (e.g. `__partialJson`) through `event-controller.ts`, transcript rebuilds in `ui-helpers.ts`, and merged call/result rendering in `tool-execution.ts`. Missing one path causes inconsistent previews.
- `ToolExecutionComponent.#buildRenderContext()` for bash must work even before a result exists — the renderer uses call args plus render context to show the command preview while streaming.
- Verify both live streaming and rebuilt transcript paths after any bash preview change. A fix in one path does not fix the other.

## Rust Build Profiles

Profiles live in the root `Cargo.toml`; `.cargo/config.toml` carries the settings Cargo.toml cannot express. Both are committed, so no local `~/.cargo/config.toml` is required.

| Profile | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `dev` | Default. Line tables for our crates, no debuginfo for deps, deps at `opt-level = 2`. |
| `release` | Shipping build: fat LTO, 1 codegen unit, stripped. |
| `local` | Fast local release iteration: thin LTO, 16 codegen units, incremental. |
| `profiling` | `release` codegen with symbols kept, for `perf`/`samply`/Instruments. |
| `ci` | Thin LTO, no debuginfo, stripped. |

**Never set `split-debuginfo = "off"` on a profile that has debuginfo.** On Mach-O the linker never merges DWARF into the executable — it writes a debug map (`N_OSO`) pointing at the `.o` files, and `"unpacked"` is what keeps those files. With `"off"` every backtrace frame in our own crates silently loses `file:line`; the `panicked at foo.rs:3` header still prints (that is `#[track_caller]`, not debuginfo), which makes the loss easy to miss. `ci` may use `"off"` only because it sets `debug = false`.

`embed-metadata = false` (in `.cargo/config.toml`) keeps crate metadata in `.rmeta` instead of duplicating it into every rlib — measured 196 MB → 130 MB on a reqwest-sized graph at identical build times. Its accepted spelling is toolchain-coupled; keep it in sync with `rust-toolchain.toml`.

Rejected, with measurements, so nobody re-litigates them: **sccache** (cannot cache incremental, bin, or proc-macro crates — measured slower than not using it), **mold** (ELF-only; no Mach-O support), and **`panic = "abort"` on `dev`** (Cargo ignores `panic` for the test profile, so the whole dep graph builds twice — 131 MB → 214 MB).

## Testing Guidance

Test the contract the system exposes — not the easiest internal detail to assert.

- Every new test must defend one **concrete, externally observable contract**: behavior, output shape, state transition, error mapping, or a regression-prone parsing boundary. If you cannot name the contract, do not add the test.

### Good vs. bad test filter

- **Name the failure mode.** Every test MUST state what a consumer observes if it regresses. Cannot name one? NEVER add it.
- **Good: transformation.** One fixture MAY prove parse/render/normalize/encode/resolve behavior when output is computed, not echoed.
- **Good: branch or boundary.** Distinct inputs, empty values, malformed input, version/provider routing, and state transitions MUST prove distinct outcomes.
- **Good: external contract.** Exact bytes/shape MAY be asserted when a provider, parser, protocol, or persisted consumer reads them.
- **Good: precedence or negative contract.** Keep explicit `false`/override-wins assertions and required absence only when they prevent a documented leak, downgrade, 400, or incompatible wire field.
- **Good: regression.** A repro MUST trigger the prior real failure path and assert the corrected observable result.
- **Bad: static echo.** NEVER test a constructor/builder merely copied a fixture or baked constant into an in-memory config/metadata field.
- **Bad: success passthrough.** NEVER assert `fn(x) === x` when `x` was already supplied/declared valid; assert a transform, rejection, or downstream effect instead.
- **Bad: wording/defaults.** NEVER assert prompt/UI boilerplate, a default literal, object existence, non-empty output, or length growth without a consumer contract.
- **Bad: duplicate rows.** Parameterized/loop rows MUST each cover a distinct branch, provider/model path, or consumer contract; delete same-path duplicates.
- **Metadata exception.** Exact metadata, identity, ordering, or `undefined` MAY remain only when a downstream consumer depends on it and the test establishes branch, precedence, negative-contract, wire, or regression evidence.
- **Termination exception.** For cyclic/large inputs, assert a bounded output, surfaced error, or state change; bare `not.toThrow()` is insufficient.
- No placeholder tests, tautologies, or "the code ran" assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`, bare `not.toThrow()`, non-empty string checks, length-grew checks, "prompt exists" checks without semantic assertion).
- Prefer contract-level tests over implementation details. Avoid asserting internal helper wiring, field assignment, singleton identity, incidental ordering, prompt boilerplate, or passthrough option forwarding unless another component depends on that exact detail.
- Don't duplicate coverage across abstraction levels. If an integration test already proves the behavior, drop the narrower unit test that restates it through mocks.
- Tests **must be full-suite safe**, not just file-local safe. No long-lived file-wide mutations of `Bun.*`, `process.platform`, `process.env`, or `Bun.env` when a narrower seam exists. Prefer per-test `vi.spyOn(...)` with `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`. A test that passes alone but poisons later files is broken.
- **Never use `mock.module()`**. Bun's `mock.module()` mutates the global module registry and leaks across files ([oven-sh/bun#12823](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/12823)). Use `spyOn` on the imported module object instead. For pass deps, import the pass and spy on `.run`. For package deps, namespace-import and spy on the exported function.
- For lifecycle/stateful code, prefer one test per invariant or transition over several tiny tests asserting one field each from the same transition.
- For error handling, trigger the real failure path and assert the surfaced contract — don't instantiate error classes directly or inspect internal metadata.
- Smoke tests are acceptable only when they catch a failure mode narrower tests would miss. "Package boots" or "command starts" alone is not enough.
- Assert exact strings, ordering, and formatting only when downstream code parses or depends on the exact bytes. Otherwise assert semantic content.
- Compile-time guarantees → type checks/type tests, not runtime placeholders.
- **Never source-grep.** A test that reads an implementation file (`.ts`/`.rs`/build script) and asserts on its _text_ — `expect(src).toContain("someCall()")`, `.toMatch(/import .../)`, `.not.toContain("oldName")`, or "comment must say X" — is banned. It tests how code _looks_, not what it _does_: it breaks on harmless refactors (comment reflow, rename, import reorder) and passes while the behavior is broken. Assert the observable contract instead (run the code, check output/state/error), use the runtime smoke probe for wiring you cannot exercise in-process, and enforce structural invariants (no value-import of X, no self-import) with a type test or an oxlint rule — never a string scan of the source. (Reading a file your code _wrote_ — apply-patch result, generated bundle, temp fixture — and asserting on that output is fine; that is behavior, not a source grep.)
- Don't add tests for tiny low-risk changes unless they protect a real contract or fix a regression-prone edge case.
- Prefer focused package-local verification for the changed area.

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (per package).

**Format** — sections under `## [Unreleased]`:

- `### Breaking Changes` (first if present)
- `### Added`
- `### Changed`
- `### Fixed`
- `### Removed`

**Rules:**

- New entries always go under `## [Unreleased]`.
- Entries are one line, brief, and user-facing: lead with what the user will see or can now do. Root-cause narration and implementation detail belong in the commit/PR, not the changelog.
- Never modify already-released sections (e.g., `## [0.12.2]`) — they are immutable.
- Don't flag changelog section order or formatting in reviews or PRs — `bun run release` runs `fix-changelogs` which normalizes everything automatically.

**Attribution:**

- Internal (from issues): `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/123))`.
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`.

### Release log completeness (pre-tag gate)

Every Zeta release tag (`v*`) MUST ship complete logs **before** the tag is
pushed; CI never fixes logs for you. `release-v2.ts` runs a preflight gate that
refuses to bump while any log is missing:

1. **Package CHANGELOGs keep ONLY the Zeta version line.** Each
   `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` may only carry `[Unreleased]` and Zeta versions
   (`[1.0.x]`, `[1.1.x]`, …). Upstream OMP version sections (`[15.x]`–`[18.x]`)
   must never appear: OMP's changelog is a subset of Zeta's, so upstream
   changes are folded into the Zeta `[Unreleased]` entry at sync time, never
   kept under upstream version headers. The preflight fails while any package
   still matches `## [1[5-8].`.
2. **Every package `[Unreleased]` is non-empty at release time.** Each released
   package records its user-visible changes since the last release (sync or
   Zeta work) — an empty `[Unreleased]` is a pre-tag gate failure.
3. **`UPDATE-LOG.md` carries the release entry.** Version, date,
   added/fixed/removed items, and the OMP sync baseline under
   `## 下一版本（Unreleased）`; the sync baseline must be current. The preflight
   verifies the section is non-empty.
4. **README.md version badge stays in lock-step.** `badge/zeta-<version>-` is
   rewritten by `set-version.ts` and `release-v2.ts`; the version-line
   consistency check (`scripts/check-version-consistency.ts`, wired into CI)
   fails if it drifts.

The pre-tag gate in `release-v2.ts` runs before any bump:
- no `## [1[5-8].` upstream version sections in any `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md`
- every package `[Unreleased]` section has at least one entry line
- `UPDATE-LOG.md` `## 下一版本（Unreleased）` is non-empty

**Zeta uses one version line for everything.** All 14 published `@linxiraos/*`
packages (the 11 core packages plus the 3 native leaves `natives`/`omptype`/`wire`)
ride the same release version, and the root `workspaces.catalog` (13 keys),
`Cargo.toml` workspace version, the `__piNativesVX_Y_Z` sentinel, and
`desktop/package.json` + `desktop/package-lock.json` follow in lock-step. There
is no separate leaf version — the 1.0.6/1.0.7 era shipped natives at
1.0.2/1.0.4 while zeta rode 1.0.6/1.0.7, which broke `zeta update` with
`ETARGET No matching version found for @linxiraos/pi-natives@1.0.7`. Never
introduce a second version line: any version drift across the 14 packages,
catalog, Cargo, or sentinel is a release-blocking bug.

Version bumps are a script operation, never hand edits:

1. Ensure all changes since last release are in each affected package's `[Unreleased]` section.
2. Run `bun scripts/release-v2.ts <version> [--watch]` (e.g. `bun scripts/release-v2.ts 1.0.8`).

The script bumps all 14 packages, Cargo.toml, and the pi-natives sentinel
(`__piNativesVX_Y_Z` in `crates/pi-natives/src/lib.rs` + the committed
bindings in `packages/natives/native/index.{js,d.ts}`), rewrites the 14 root
catalog keys, regenerates `bun.lock`, finalizes all 14 CHANGELOGs, runs
`check:ts`, then commits (`chore: bump version to <version>`), tags
(`v<version>`), and pushes atomically. The pushed commit triggers CI, which
runs the full gate and — because HEAD carries the tag — the release/publish
jobs. If a fix lands after a failed release run, commit the fix, then re-push
main **and** force-move the tag to the new HEAD in one command so
`release_metadata` sees `is-release=true`:

```
git push --force origin refs/heads/main:refs/heads/main "$(git rev-parse HEAD):refs/tags/v<version>"
```

`bun run release` (the legacy script) is deprecated: it moves the leaves to
the release version via blind regexes and is not the release path.

Related rule: Redis session-storage keys use the `zeta:sessions:` prefix
(see `packages/coding-agent/src/session/redis-session-storage.ts`). Do not
reintroduce `omp:` prefixed keys or Lua-script comments.
