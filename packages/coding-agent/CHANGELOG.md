## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 新增 tea 工具套件：面向自托管 Gitea（及 gitea.com）的 `tea` CLI 集成，提供仓库/议题/拉取请求/检出/合并/发行版等 op（`repo_view`、`repo_create`、`issue_*`、`pr_*`、`release_*`），创建类操作一律 API 回读验证（`tea repo create` 有静默失败史）；通过 `gitea.enabled` 启用，默认关闭。

## [1.1.27] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- Added last-chance consumption of eligible banked Codex and Claude resets expiring within five minutes when auto-redeem is enabled, even with low usage or reserved credits.
- Added inline rendering of agent-generated SVG diagrams, charts, and mockups, with theme-aware colors and a `tui.renderSvg` setting to disable it.
- Added automatic chart generation for numeric tables, configurable with `tui.autoGraph` (`always`, `smart`, or `off`). The agent now chooses suitable visual formats—including charts, Mermaid, SVG, tables, or prose—based on the content. Charts and this guidance apply to the main TUI session only, not to subagents, print, RPC, or ACP.
- Added first-class JSON and JSONL querying to the `read` tool with `?q=<jq-filter>`, including in-process filtering, raw or compact output, and offset/limit pagination for efficient large-file access.
- Added `/prewalk off` to cancel a pending model handoff without changing the active model, saved prewalk setting, or continuation history.
- Added logout support to RPC clients through `get_logout_accounts` and `logout`, with matching methods in the TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust SDKs.
- Added custom model-kind declarations for providers and extensions, allowing image, speech, embedding, judge, and other supported model roles to be registered and routed correctly.
- Added working-directory reporting for Tern terminal sessions so the native composer bar can display the current folder.

### Changed

- Improved JSON and JSONL query streaming and pagination to reduce resource usage, support partial results, and provide clearer continuation between result pages.
- Clarified the `read` tool documentation with complete examples for requesting line ranges.

### Fixed

- Fixed model-preset tests failing when provider credentials are configured in the environment.
- Fixed unauthenticated Macs auto-selecting the on-device Apple model when the default prompt exceeds its context window; Apple remains selectable explicitly.
- Fixed replay and compaction tests failing after bundled model roster changes.
- Fixed standalone builds failing when the native addon archive could not be resolved.
- Fixed JSON query parsing and parameter decoding for filters beginning with hyphens and other encoded query values.
- Fixed task execution after settings could not be saved; subagents now use the current in-memory settings while the save failure is reported as a warning.
- Fixed prewalk and model-recovery state across `/new`, handoffs, cancellations, and automatic recovery.
- Fixed login, logout, model refresh, and provider-status reporting for aliased providers such as `openai-codex-device`.
- Fixed model speed statistics mixing fast service-tier results into standard-tier averages; `/models` now reports the applicable tier separately.
- Fixed the `write` and `edit` tools hanging or consuming excessive resources when given FIFOs, terminals, device files, or other non-regular targets; unsupported targets are now rejected safely.
- Fixed long conversations losing user or tool-result images because assistant-generated images were counted against provider image limits.
- Fixed local session paths for special session IDs such as `.` and `..` so they cannot escape the intended storage directory.
- Fixed `omp gc --archive --apply` leaving orphaned session-title records behind.
- Fixed `/retry` after an interrupted process exit while an extension-driven prompt was reopening.
- Fixed browser relay sessions failing to discover or interact with cross-origin iframe content that loaded before the tab was opened.
- Fixed browser clicks on visually styled radios and checkboxes whose underlying inputs are hidden.
- Fixed `/model` failing to switch when selecting the model already assigned to a project's default role.
- Fixed `wait` returning early when a background completion had already been consumed by another operation.
- Fixed symlinked routing configurations failing to reload after their target links were replaced.
- Fixed repeated coding-plan fallback confirmations in cases involving changing thinking settings, unavailable quota information, or account recovery.
- Fixed Python evaluation failing when a shared runner temporary directory was created by another user.
- Fixed RPC clients being unable to complete multi-select questions in multi-question `ask` prompts.
- Corrected inaccurate tool and setting descriptions, including `read` ranges, background `bash` behavior, Python evaluation capabilities, edit replacement guidance, goal removal behavior, and `advisor.immuneTurns`.
- Fixed custom glob backends hanging indefinitely; scans now honor tool deadlines and cancellation.
- Fixed `--resume <path>` silently creating a new session when the specified path did not exist; it now reports the missing path.
- Fixed `/settings` opening duplicate menus when invoked while the settings menu was already open.
- Fixed native Git operations resolving repositories incorrectly when run through symbolic links.

1.1.26] - 2026-10-03

- 版本线推进至 1.1.26；本版无独立用户可见变化。

## [1.1.24] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Skills in nested router trees (up to 3 levels, e.g. `.agents/skills` router → category → leaf) are now all discoverable, and `skills.enableOfficial` actually toggles the bundled official skills.

### Changed

- Usage/help strings across `config`/`plugin`/`setup`/`update`/`login`/`shell`/`web-search` and the docs corpus show canonical bin names only (`zetacode`/`zetaide`/`zetaeditor`); spaced forms like "zeta code" no longer appear anywhere user-visible.

### Fixed

- Session exit tips and every command example now name the coding CLI (`zeta-c`) instead of the workbench `zeta` — following the old `zeta --resume <id>` hint silently opened the Zetawork workbench and did nothing.
- `--resume` ids pasted with a trailing `/` (or a `.jsonl` suffix) resolve as session ids again; an explicit transcript path that does not exist now errors with a usage hint instead of silently minting an empty session.
- `update` on Windows no longer writes or retires the workbench `zeta` shims (it manages only this package's `zeta-c`/`zeta-cli`/`zetacode`), and its GitHub/mise fallbacks point at Linxira-OS/linxira-zeta.
- npm source installs no longer silently miss the bundled official skills, and reseeding the official-skills embed prunes stale files.
- Plugins get a per-plugin storage contract: `pi.storage` (`dataDir`/`cacheDir`/`stateDir` under `~/.zeta/plugins/`) is injected into every extension factory, with `adoptLegacyFileOnce` as the one-time migration primitive — plugins no longer need to invent their own paths in the user data tree.
- Models already configured in upstream OMP (`~/.zeta/agent/models.yml` providers and `/login` API keys) now appear in the model list automatically, badged "来自 OMP" — read-only mapping, keys reused in memory, Zeta-local config always wins; nothing is written back to the upstream install.

## [1.1.16] - 2026-09-19

- 上游 v18.2.5 同步:streaming CLI 命令、热路径记忆化(工具 schema/stamp/which 缓存)、TUI 主题与覆盖层组件迁移至 pi-tui、Astra 上下文确定性策略、eval 判定桥与 Python prelude 维护。
- 修复 bun 1.4.0 bytecode 编译产物启动崩溃(desktop smoke 全平台)。
- 设置项新增 Stream 分区与 stencil.so 流式认证。

## [1.1.13] - 2026-09-10

- 上游 v18.1.16 同步:任务执行器 AgentBusyError、事件循环 keepalive、idle 封装截止时间、上下文笔记等。
- 修复中文界面设置布尔项无法关闭的问题(显示文案误入机器值匹配)。
- `/language` 切换后斜杠命令描述即时刷新,无需重启。
- Plan/Plan-ultra/Vibe/Goal 模式横幅与 attach 模式提示接入 i18n;`/loop`、`/rename` 描述进目录。

## [1.1.10] - 2026-09-07

- Fixed `edit` auto-repair waiting up to 60 seconds when the `smol` model does not respond; it now times out after 20 seconds and reports repair start and timeout details.
- Fixed subagents leaving queued parent messages behind after tool interruptions.
- Fixed a subagent burning its whole run on `yield` calls that never finish it: an incremental-only `yield` turn no longer bypasses the request budget, and the forced final `yield` ends the run ([#12351](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/12351) by [@pedropaulovc](https://github.com/pedropaulovc)).
- Fixed `browser.open({ app: { relay: true } })` waiting for the full tool timeout when no relay extension is installed or reachable; it now fails promptly with an actionable error while preserving the wait for a connected extension to recover.
- Fixed `edit` handling of ellipsis markers, inline closing tags, copy-ready corrections, and retries, including cases that could insert literal markers, misreport matches, omit the file target, or panic.
- Enabled `edit.enforceSeenLines` by default to reject hashline edits anchored to content that was not displayed, and prevented stale-tag recovery from applying edits to a structurally different duplicate construct ([#12369](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/12369) by [@pedropaulovc](https://github.com/pedropaulovc)).
- Fixed startup failures when the plugins directory or its manifest cannot be read; inaccessible plugin roots are now skipped with a warning.
- Fixed generation token-rate displays for subagents and restored the main session's reading after switching focus.
- Fixed subagent HUD labels and plan filenames being populated with example prompt text on smaller models.
- Improved shell, file, session, and persistence operations to avoid unnecessary repeated work, improving responsiveness and resource usage.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- OMP v18.1.10 sync baseline (`f241301c8372`): native Rust edit engine (EditStore/EditSession/DiffStream) behind the `edit` tool, `skillful` setting + `/skillful` per-session skill listing, agent emoji reactions (`tui.reactions`), plan-aware read window preserved for plan files, upstream security-scan command family rebranded, extension/agent discovery hardening.
- TUI settings page fully localized (zh): tabs, group headings, option values, footer hints, preview chrome and slash-command descriptions now follow the configured language; `/language` applies live.

### Fixed

- Sidebar renders again in production sessions: the gutter engine was anchored to the fallback render path after the upstream frame-provider refactor, so `tui.sidebar=true` drew nothing; provider frames now respect the reserved main width and paint the right gutter column. Sidebar content rebuilt to stop duplicating the status line (session header, todo/plan progress, subagent states, MCP health; empty panels hide).
- Channel tools (`channel_send`/`workspace_run`/`im_control`) are once again exclusive to top-level sessions — nested subagents can no longer relay to IM even when the tool names are requested explicitly; `tracking_update` gating restored.
- Windows installer (`install.ps1`) restored to the Zeta package/repo/binary names after the merge pulled the upstream OMP form back in.
- Base system prompt refresh only re-applies on byte-level changes, keeping the inherited provider prompt-cache key stable across explicit refreshes.
- i18n: zh catalog no longer carries OMP self-references; `/security` descriptions use the clean Zeta keys.
- Idle compaction now starts or reschedules when its enabled state, threshold, or delay changes while a session is already idle ([#10242](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10242)).
- Fixed `todo` and other tools called through eval rejecting optional `None`/`null` arguments that direct tool calls accept.
- Report oversized selected lines that cannot fit after read context, with a working raw recovery selector instead of a looping continuation hint ([#10775](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10775)).

## [1.1.6] - 2026-08-30

- Fixed prewalk conflicting with `todo.eager=always`: the forced eager-todo prelude ("call todo first this turn") was injected alongside the prewalk plan nudge ("write a complete plan first, then todo"), giving the model contradictory instructions; the eager-todo prelude is now suppressed only when prewalk will perform a handoff ([#10510](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10510)).
- Fixed `authHeader: true` + command-backed `apiKey` discovery providers (no explicit `headers:` block) resending a stale bearer after a 401 force-refresh; discovered models now re-derive `Authorization` from the live `apiKey` each request ([#10551](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10551)).
- Fixed the embedded shell's `command -v`/`-V` honoring only the first operand: it now iterates every name like bash/zsh, printing one line per resolved name and skipping misses ([#10544](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10544)).
- Fixed hard-killed subagents vanishing from the agent registry under concurrent fan-out: `AgentLifecycleManager.release` now applies the terminal `aborted` transition before awaiting the tombstone sidecar write, closing a race where the dying session's own dispose-path unregister deleted the ref instead of leaving it as a tombstone ([#10531](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10531)).
- `omp commit` now keeps extension-provided model credentials available in its nested commit-agent session ([#10528](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10528)).
- MCP tool results now surface `structuredContent`: servers that return their payload in the structured channel while keeping `content` a terse ack (e.g. rhizome-mcp) are no longer data-less to the model ([#10522](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10522)).
- Fixed the Agent Hub roster shuffling erratically while open: rows no longer re-sort on every agent heartbeat, so the list stays stable and navigable with many active agents ([#10524](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10524)).
- Exiting Vibe mode now removes its restrictions from subsequent model turns, including restored sessions ([#10500](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10500)).
- Fixed all-sessions listing (`Tab` in session picker) and cross-project resume failing when sessions are stored under `XDG_DATA_HOME`; `listAllSessions` now scans the active `getSessionsDir()` root instead of hardcoding `~/.zeta/agent/sessions`.
- Fixed the Nerd Font context icon showing a Windows logo instead of a generic window ([#10476](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10476) by [@erickmazer](https://github.com/erickmazer)).
- The debug terminal snapshot now reports Herdr (and CMUX) as the multiplexer wrapping the session, matching the TUI's pane-identity detection instead of only tmux/screen/zellij.
- Fixed vibe mode becoming un-exitable after branching a session (including via `/btw`), which previously failed with "Vibe parent session changed before mode exit could be persisted." ([#10468](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10468)).
- Fixed HTML session exports reordering interleaved assistant text, thinking, images, and tool calls in the transcript, and split matching text/tool sidebar rows with block-accurate navigation. ([#10253](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10253) by [@realcoderandom](https://github.com/realcoderandom))
- Fixed the built-in `grep` and `sed` treating a basic regular expression as an extended one: a bare `+` is now the literal and `\+` the operator, patterns like `^+` or `s/^\+/` no longer match every line, `^` anchors inside `\(…\)` and after `\|`, and a repetition operator with nothing to repeat is reported instead of silently selecting the whole file ([#10298](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10298) by [@mruangutai](https://github.com/mruangutai)).
- Fixed RPC `prompt` responses for `/skill:*` commands arriving only after the entire prompt-dispatch pipeline finished (usage preflight, compaction, provider calls): under provider stress that outlasts any client prompt timeout, so hosts reported the prompt as rejected while the turn was in fact running. The skill branch now builds the skill prompt eagerly (preserving the immediate error for an unreadable skill file) and dispatches the expensive pipeline asynchronously after answering, matching plain prompts; when the dispatch is cancelled before a turn starts (e.g. an abort overtakes usage preflight), the session now reports it through the non-invoked completion frame instead of leaving hosts waiting for an that never comes ([#10249](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10249) by [@cwr250](https://github.com/cwr250)).
- Fixed stale `omp-plugins.lock.json` entries loading leftover `node_modules` trees for plugins no longer declared in an existing `package.json` — the orphaned copy double-loaded its extensions. Lockfile-only plugins remain supported for manifest-less roots and symlinked packages (`omp plugin link`, marketplace runtime packages); stale entries are skipped with a warning.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-08-26

- 同步上游 OMP v18.0.5 / v18.0.6：git TUI 内置 conventional commit 生成与 `if-bench` 基准、`commit --legacy` 统一生成、`:img` 选择器渲染 SVG、新增 Yolo-Auto / OpenRouter 浏览器登录与 DeepInfra image_gen/tts。

### Fixed

- 修复 `/language` 与 `/tracking` 指令在 OMP v18.0.3 合并后未注册的问题（输入被当作普通消息；现已恢复注册并加合并护栏测试）。

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- release 资产命名系统化：CLI 二进制统一为 `zeta-cli-*`，桌面安装包统一为 `zeta-desktop-<version>-<os>-<arch>`。

### Fixed

- 修复中文系统下 CLI 汉化自动检测失效（`language` 默认值不再顶掉环境检测，中文系统自动切换中文界面）。

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Republished as 1.1.2 to reset the `latest` tag after the broken 1.1.0 (no functional change over 1.1.1).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Published tarballs now carry real dependency versions instead of Bun's `catalog:` protocol (1.1.0 installs failed with "Unsupported URL Type catalog:").

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- TUI 渲染升级至上游 v18.0.3 架构（provider window + resize 重绘），终端尺寸变化即时重绘。

## [1.0.10] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added a web gateway `enter_plan_mode` command and a session `enterPlanMode` path so the web-ui `/plan` slash command actually enters plan mode (plan file, `write` tool, plan-approval wiring, optional initial prompt) instead of forwarding a literal message.
- Added an interactive confirm to `zeta update` before installing a new version (default no on non-TTY input); `--yes`/`-y` skips it.
- Added WeChat `/api/v1/wechat` login (QR + status polling) with legacy iLink fallback, persisted peer→context_token bindings in `web.yml` (`channels.wechat.peerTokens`), and a `POST /api/channels/wechat/unbind` gateway route that resets the channel and clears credentials.

### Changed

- WeChat login now prefers the new `/api/v1/wechat` endpoints (endpoint host configurable via `channels.wechat.endpoint`); older hosts fall back to the legacy iLink QR flow.

### Fixed

- Fixed the transcript collapsing into a compact no-spacing layout whenever the prompt, todo HUD, or other below-transcript chrome grew a few rows; the live tail now scrolls off the top instead.
- Fixed transcript layout and rebuilding issues that could collapse blank rows, leave tool calls displayed on one line, or show stale fragments after navigation, display changes, or compaction ([#12177](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/12177) by [@shivamklr](https://github.com/shivamklr)).
- Fixed the `security-reviewer` agent so valid findings with anchors and remediation details are accepted.
- Stopping a subagent from Agent Hub now settles and reports its parent background job instead of leaving `hub wait` blocked indefinitely.
- Fixed prewalk handoff detection after edits or writes dispatched through Code Mode eval cells.
- Reduced main-thread stalls while streaming large edits by deferring AST-based matching until the edit is complete.
- Corrected the `/handoff` description so it accurately reflects that the command creates a handoff document and compacts the current session.
- Deferred misleading cold-cache `retry.fallbackChains` warnings until provider discovery completes.
- Fixed `--prewalk-into @default` so an explicitly selected startup model does not replace the configured default role, including ordered fallbacks and discovery-backed candidates.
- A corrupted or externally modified session file no longer leaves the session impossible to close; a subsequent Ctrl+C exits without rewriting the session log.
- Fixed silent MCP requests being terminated by an undeclared idle timeout; closing a legacy SSE connection now also cancels pending requests and notifications.
- Fixed browser reuse for Chromium installed behind Linux wrapper scripts and prevented duplicate launches when a profile is locked ([#12236](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/12236) by [@shivamklr](https://github.com/shivamklr)).
