## [1.1.11] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Muse Code provider support end to end: subscription sign-in with credential refresh, inference, live account-scoped model discovery, and quota reporting in `/usage` with durable rate-limit backoff; Muse Code sessions send a compact hashline edit description (~3 KB less per request), all other providers keep the full prompt.

### Changed

- The startup update notice now counts every change in a release: bullets above a `###` heading count under Other, `+`/`*` markers and lightly indented bullets count like `-`, and standalone `* * *` / `- - -` separator lines no longer count as changes.

### Fixed

- GPT-6 Astra keeps its documented 1.05M-token window with `/extended-context` on or off; explicit per-model `contextWindow` overrides still win. Codex Astra defaults to 272K and clamps explicit overrides to the server-honored ceiling; the extended window bills at the documented 2x input / 1.5x output long-context tier above 272K input, while the Codex subscription route stays exempt with free cache writes.
- Fixed Extended Context silently enabling without a settings source (SDK embedding, early boot); it now matches the off default until opted in.
- Fixed fullscreen `/copy` link captions showing Markdown delimiters for formatted labels and splitting across two rows for multiline labels; it also outlines grouped Read cards correctly so Enter copies the assistant yield.
- Fixed Ask custom answers requiring another submission after paste or stalling on multi-select questions; pending clipboard text is preserved, single-question multi-select still goes through review.
- Fixed `/loop` replacing the repeating prompt with a mid-turn interjection: steering while the agent runs is one-off, and only an idle submission becomes the new loop body.
- `memory://` resolves against the session that issued it: a caller's own memory backend answers `memory://<id>`, co-located sessions no longer read each other's memory rows, and a dead caller fails closed; prompt completion binds to the same caller.
- Subagent `yield` no longer rejects a valid `data` payload when a non-strict OpenAI-compatible backend fills the optional `error` field with `""`.
- Zeta merge adaptation: the `/plan-ultra` command and its registry entry, plus localized slash-command descriptions, are guarded against being dropped by upstream merges (i18n contract test now enforces M.* keys).

## [1.1.10] - 2026-09-07

- Task descriptions containing tabs no longer misalign or overflow task rows; tabs are expanded before measuring and rendering.
- GitHub Copilot model-policy 403s (plan, model policy, org restriction) no longer delete stored credentials, so the provider stays listed in `/model` after a per-model access denial instead of disappearing until the next `/login` ([#11280](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/11280) by [@H4vC](https://github.com/H4vC)).
- Bash results no longer replace a failing command's output with the shell minimizer's lossy summary when the original capture cannot be persisted as an artifact; the raw diagnostics are kept so a failure stays actionable ([#11081](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/11081)).
- Fixed worker subprocesses failing to declare themselves as worker hosts before dispatching selectors, which prevented nested thread worker spawns during `/usage` stats sync on multi-core systems.
- Fixed `/usage` displaying a misleading generic database read failure when activity loading fails; the error detail is now sanitized, collapsed to a single line with shortened paths, and surfaced in the dashboard.
- Advisor notes now report rate limiting accurately, blockers always interrupt even after a lower-severity note in the same update, and deferred notes flush when the primary run completes, including after advisor quota exhaustion ([#11062](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/11062)).
- Fixed the built-in clangd registration omitting CUDA source and header files (`.cu` and `.cuh`) ([#10782](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10782) by [@alphastorm](https://github.com/alphastorm)).
- Fixed `ast_grep` skipping CUDA headers and ignoring an explicit `lang` override for ambiguous file extensions ([#10782](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10782) by [@alphastorm](https://github.com/alphastorm)).
- Python cells are no longer replayed automatically after a kernel crash, preventing duplicate side effects; the next call starts a fresh kernel.
- Session rewrites preserve open-reader snapshots and replacement identity when a rename needs an EPERM fallback.
- Fixed WorkPool children retaining a stale Gemini-formatted `yield` declaration when pooled items were installed or cleared.
- Preserve effective context and output limits when model overrides change unrelated settings, such as thinking effort levels.

## [1.1.9] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- OMP v18.1.10 sync baseline (`f241301c8372`): native Rust edit engine (EditStore/EditSession/DiffStream) behind the `edit` tool, `skillful` setting + `/skillful` per-session skill listing, agent emoji reactions (`tui.reactions`), plan-aware read window preserved for plan files, upstream security-scan command family rebranded, extension/agent discovery hardening.
- TUI settings page fully localized (zh): tabs, group headings, option values, footer hints, preview chrome and slash-command descriptions now follow the configured language; `/language` applies live.

### Fixed

- Sidebar renders again in production sessions: the gutter engine was anchored to the fallback render path after the upstream frame-provider refactor, so `tui.sidebar=true` drew nothing; provider frames now respect the reserved main width and paint the right gutter column. Sidebar content rebuilt to stop duplicating the status line (session header, todo/plan progress, subagent states, MCP health; empty panels hide).
- Channel tools (`channel_send`/`workspace_run`/`im_control`) are once again exclusive to top-level sessions — nested subagents can no longer relay to IM even when the tool names are requested explicitly; `tracking_update` gating restored.
- Windows installer (`install.ps1`) restored to the Zeta package/repo/binary names after the merge pulled the upstream OMP form back in.
- Base system prompt refresh only re-applies on byte-level changes, keeping the inherited provider prompt-cache key stable across explicit refreshes.
- i18n: zh catalog no longer carries OMP self-references; `/security` descriptions use the clean Zeta keys.
- Idle compaction now starts or reschedules when its enabled state, threshold, or delay changes while a session is already idle ([#10242](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10242)).
- Fixed `todo` and other tools called through eval rejecting optional `None`/`null` arguments that direct tool calls accept.
- Report oversized selected lines that cannot fit after read context, with a working raw recovery selector instead of a looping continuation hint ([#10775](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10775)).
- Approved plan content is now inlined into approve-and-execute prompts instead of forcing the executor to re-read the durable plan file ([#10923](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10923)).
- Fixed WorkPool child sessions crashing during startup while constructing their incremental `yield` tool schema.
- Commit summaries written in Vietnamese, Korean, and other accented scripts are no longer rejected for exceeding the length limit, and keep their accents as typed.
- Tool-scoped TTSR rules now match finalized arguments reliably when providers stream short or throttled tool calls ([#10910](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10910)).
- Restored `getSupportedThinkingLevels` in the legacy `pi-ai` shim so extensions importing it from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (e.g. `@companion-ai/feynman`) pass Bun's named-export check and load ([#10800](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10800)).

## [1.1.6] - 2026-08-30

- Fixed prewalk conflicting with `todo.eager=always`: the forced eager-todo prelude ("call todo first this turn") was injected alongside the prewalk plan nudge ("write a complete plan first, then todo"), giving the model contradictory instructions; the eager-todo prelude is now suppressed only when prewalk will perform a handoff ([#10510](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10510)).
- Fixed `authHeader: true` + command-backed `apiKey` discovery providers (no explicit `headers:` block) resending a stale bearer after a 401 force-refresh; discovered models now re-derive `Authorization` from the live `apiKey` each request ([#10551](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10551)).
- Fixed the embedded shell's `command -v`/`-V` honoring only the first operand: it now iterates every name like bash/zsh, printing one line per resolved name and skipping misses ([#10544](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10544)).
- Fixed hard-killed subagents vanishing from the agent registry under concurrent fan-out: `AgentLifecycleManager.release` now applies the terminal `aborted` transition before awaiting the tombstone sidecar write, closing a race where the dying session's own dispose-path unregister deleted the ref instead of leaving it as a tombstone ([#10531](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10531)).
- `omp commit` now keeps extension-provided model credentials available in its nested commit-agent session ([#10528](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10528)).
- MCP tool results now surface `structuredContent`: servers that return their payload in the structured channel while keeping `content` a terse ack (e.g. rhizome-mcp) are no longer data-less to the model ([#10522](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10522)).
- Fixed the Agent Hub roster shuffling erratically while open: rows no longer re-sort on every agent heartbeat, so the list stays stable and navigable with many active agents ([#10524](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10524)).
- Exiting Vibe mode now removes its restrictions from subsequent model turns, including restored sessions ([#10500](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10500)).
- Fixed all-sessions listing (`Tab` in session picker) and cross-project resume failing when sessions are stored under `XDG_DATA_HOME`; `listAllSessions` now scans the active `getSessionsDir()` root instead of hardcoding `~/.zeta/agent/sessions`.
- Fixed the Nerd Font context icon showing a Windows logo instead of a generic window ([#10476](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10476) by [@erickmazer](https://github.com/erickmazer)).
- The debug terminal snapshot now reports Herdr (and CMUX) as the multiplexer wrapping the session, matching the TUI's pane-identity detection instead of only tmux/screen/zellij.
- Fixed vibe mode becoming un-exitable after branching a session (including via `/btw`), which previously failed with "Vibe parent session changed before mode exit could be persisted." ([#10468](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/10468)).
- Fixed HTML session exports reordering interleaved assistant text, thinking, images, and tool calls in the transcript, and split matching text/tool sidebar rows with block-accurate navigation. ([#10253](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10253) by [@realcoderandom](https://github.com/realcoderandom))
- Fixed the built-in `grep` and `sed` treating a basic regular expression as an extended one: a bare `+` is now the literal and `\+` the operator, patterns like `^+` or `s/^\+/` no longer match every line, `^` anchors inside `\(…\)` and after `\|`, and a repetition operator with nothing to repeat is reported instead of silently selecting the whole file ([#10298](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10298) by [@mruangutai](https://github.com/mruangutai)).
- Fixed RPC `prompt` responses for `/skill:*` commands arriving only after the entire prompt-dispatch pipeline finished (usage preflight, compaction, provider calls): under provider stress that outlasts any client prompt timeout, so hosts reported the prompt as rejected while the turn was in fact running. The skill branch now builds the skill prompt eagerly (preserving the immediate error for an unreadable skill file) and dispatches the expensive pipeline asynchronously after answering, matching plain prompts; when the dispatch is cancelled before a turn starts (e.g. an abort overtakes usage preflight), the session now reports it through the non-invoked completion frame instead of leaving hosts waiting for an that never comes ([#10249](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10249) by [@cwr250](https://github.com/cwr250)).
- Fixed stale `omp-plugins.lock.json` entries loading leftover `node_modules` trees for plugins no longer declared in an existing `package.json` — the orphaned copy double-loaded its extensions. Lockfile-only plugins remain supported for manifest-less roots and symlinked packages (`omp plugin link`, marketplace runtime packages); stale entries are skipped with a warning.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-08-26

- 同步上游 OMP v18.0.5 / v18.0.6：git TUI 内置 conventional commit 生成与 `if-bench` 基准、`commit --legacy` 统一生成、`:img` 选择器渲染 SVG、新增 Yolo-Auto / OpenRouter 浏览器登录与 DeepInfra image_gen/tts。

### Fixed

- 修复 `/language` 与 `/tracking` 指令在 OMP v18.0.3 合并后未注册的问题（输入被当作普通消息；现已恢复注册并加合并护栏测试）。

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- release 资产命名系统化：CLI 二进制统一为 `zeta-cli-*`，桌面安装包统一为 `zeta-desktop-<version>-<os>-<arch>`。

### Fixed

- 修复中文系统下 CLI 汉化自动检测失效（`language` 默认值不再顶掉环境检测，中文系统自动切换中文界面）。

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Republished as 1.1.3 to reset the latest tag after the broken 1.1.2 (no functional change over 1.1.1).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Republished as 1.1.2 to reset the `latest` tag after the broken 1.1.0 (no functional change over 1.1.1).

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Published tarballs now carry real dependency versions instead of Bun's `catalog:` protocol (1.1.0 installs failed with "Unsupported URL Type catalog:").

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- TUI 渲染升级至上游 v18.0.3 架构（provider window + resize 重绘），终端尺寸变化即时重绘。
- `zeta update` 改为异步增量更新，慢盘/大文件不再阻塞交互。
- Streaming edit guard 改为异步增量验证，大文件编辑不再卡顿。

### Fixed

- Julia 内核可用性探测加固（超时上限 + 进程组击杀），冷启动不再误判为不可用。
- 中文界面本地化覆盖（zh overlay，随 v18.0.4 合并）。

### Removed

- 配置目录统一 `.zeta`，移除 `.zeta` 兼容别名路径。

## [1.0.10] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Added a web gateway `enter_plan_mode` command and a session `enterPlanMode` path so the web-ui `/plan` slash command actually enters plan mode (plan file, `write` tool, plan-approval wiring, optional initial prompt) instead of forwarding a literal message.
- Added an interactive confirm to `zeta update` before installing a new version (default no on non-TTY input); `--yes`/`-y` skips it.
- Added WeChat `/api/v1/wechat` login (QR + status polling) with legacy iLink fallback, persisted peer→context_token bindings in `web.yml` (`channels.wechat.peerTokens`), and a `POST /api/channels/wechat/unbind` gateway route that resets the channel and clears credentials.
- Added Feishu `bot_p2p_chat_entered` handling: the first private-chat contact gets an onboarding reply.
- Added `channels.allowedPeers` web-config allowlist: when non-empty, only listed peers may reach the agent.
- Added `ui:` metadata to `shellPath`, `retry.enabled`, `stt.language`, `searxng.categories/language/safesearch`, `compaction.reserveTokens/keepRecentTokens`, and `skills.enabled` so they are editable from the web settings panel.

### Changed

- WeChat login now prefers the new `/api/v1/wechat` endpoints (endpoint host configurable via `channels.wechat.endpoint`); older hosts fall back to the legacy iLink QR flow.
- Reworked the Ctrl+S Agent Hub into a responsive fullscreen roster and selected-agent inspector, featuring aggregate status/usage metrics, detailed per-agent views (task, model, activity, usage, lineage), roster and spawn-tree views, stable ordering, asynchronous persisted-session discovery, restored historical metadata, and improved keyboard and mouse navigation.
- Replaced `arktype` with `@linxiraos/omptype` for all tool parameter and configuration schemas, resulting in significantly faster startup times. Configuration schema errors are now reported via `OmpErrors` entries using the standard `path`/`problem` format.

### Fixed

- Fixed panel commands (such as `/usage` and `/advisor status`) appearing unresponsive during active turns by flushing the deferred-panel queue at every settle, terminal or not. The deferral itself stays silent: mounting a status line into the transcript mid-turn re-renders rows below the live block and duplicates them in native scrollback (issues #4806/#6767).
- Fixed the bundled `ts-no-tiny-functions` rule failing to match one-line arrow functions in files with trailing newlines.
- Fixed advisor refusals skipping the model fallback chain, and bounded refusal recovery to a single attempt per model to prevent infinite fallback loops.
- Fixed repeated `/mcp reauth` commands getting stuck by ensuring new reauthorization requests cancel and clean up any pending MCP OAuth login flows.
- Fixed WSL host-home resolution to build `/mnt/<drive>/...` fallback paths using POSIX semantics regardless of the host platform.
- Fixed Python evaluation shell helpers (`!cmd`, `%%bash`, `%pip`) letting child processes inherit the runner's stdin, which previously caused deadlocks on Windows. Additionally, `%%bash` now correctly resolves Git Bash on Windows.
- Fixed subagents spawned via model-role aliases incorrectly falling back to the `default` role's retry chain instead of their own configured role chain.
- Fixed Linux/X11 clipboard reads failing when `xclip` is missing but `xsel` is available.
- Hardened Linux Chromium executable detection to filter out non-executable files, invalid wrappers, and candidates that hang during version probes.
- Fixed Bash command preview crashes caused by malformed tool arguments containing non-string environment values.
- Fixed UI rendering in the model browser and model hub where `nerd`-preset role chips would overlap and obscure the first character of labels.
- Fixed Codex web search sending incompatible request shapes to certain models, which caused the hosted `web_search` tool to ignore them.
- Fixed resumed or rebuilt sessions incorrectly applying stale rewind reports from previous checkpoint cycles to new checkpoints.
- Fixed the `read` tool incorrectly parsing semicolon-delimited internal URLs (such as batched `skill://` resources) as a single invalid resource.
- Fixed `pi.getAllTools()` returning bare strings instead of `ToolInfo[]` objects, restoring compatibility with extensions built against the upstream contract.
- Fixed legacy extensions failing to load in compiled binaries when resolving bundled dependencies via dynamic `createRequire` factories.
- Fixed Wayland window activation and native input handling by correctly reporting them as unavailable rather than attempting unsupported foreground-delivery paths.
- Fixed live execution progress being hidden in the conversation view after approving a plan in the fullscreen Plan Review.
- Fixed `omp -r` failing to discover sessions created under the temporary hashed project-directory scheme by adding a one-way migration back to legacy path-based names.
- Prevented the `read` tool from advertising or resolving `memory://` URIs when the memory backend is disabled.
- Fixed the Shift-Tab thinking mode UI rendering the `off` state as a blank label, which made it appear that reasoning could not be disabled.
- Fixed parsing of POSIX `$EDITOR` commands that contain quoted arguments or executable paths with spaces.
- Fixed persisted Agent Hub rows losing the explicit caller model role when a subagent used a model override, preserving role provenance across restarts.
- Fixed unobserved promise rejections in browser helpers (such as `tab.waitForResponse()`) causing tab workers to hang or crash.
- Improved edit-tool error guidance for operations missing the `»` separator, identifying redundant context-only operations
- Fixed OAuth provider `modifyModels` projections being silently dropped after a discovery refresh introduced live-config headers.
- Edit-tool `＋`/`－` line operations now match their anchors leniently across whitespace drift (indentation, blank-line miscounts) instead of failing with a byte-for-byte error; a note reports the lenient match.
- Fixed an edit-tool REWRITE consisting only of `＋` add lines silently replacing (deleting) the matched text; it now inserts after the kept MATCH.
- Edit-tool no-match errors now name MATCH lines that exist nowhere in the file and suggest marking them with `＋`, and errors without a located region no longer append a misleading file-head "closest match" preview.
- Fixed ordinary CLI startup eagerly loading the computer worker graph (native desktop addon and early environment), restoring lazy startup and profile `.env` ordering.
- Fixed online auto-thinking classifier usage being omitted from session token and cost totals.
- Fixed image generation with custom provider endpoints when using `openai-codex` credentials and a non-OpenAI chat model.
- Fixed custom hook UI factories not receiving the documented `keybindings` argument.
- Fixed MCP OAuth token exchange for authorization endpoints that use a different resource indicator.
- Fixed custom extension `web_search` tools being shadowed by the built-in search tool.
- Fixed Agent Hub task boards collapsing to summary rows after returning from a focused session.
- Improved Linux ARM64 browser startup messaging when managed Chrome for Testing builds are unavailable, with guidance for using system Chromium or `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
- Fixed resuming image-heavy sessions that previously terminated while replaying transcripts.
- Fixed custom agents declaring `hub` being incorrectly treated as read-only.
- Restored compatibility for legacy Pi extensions that import `calculateContextTokens` or use the synchronous `SettingsManager.create()` API.
- Fixed custom model overrides being lost during configuration updates.
- Clarified that the default task-delegation setting follows the selected model's policy.
- Fixed `/rename` without a title interrupting active session activity.
- Fixed the Nerd Font notification persisting incorrectly after theme configuration.
- Fixed sampling parameter errors with newer Anthropic models.
- Long OpenCode Go usage-limit waits now switch replay-safe turns to a configured alternate provider when the delay exceeds `retry.maxDelayMs`.
- Fixed OpenAI Codex Responses tool results being lost when composite and plain tool-call identifiers did not match.
- Fixed `/tan` background agents failing to resolve credentials for providers supplied by extensions.
- Fixed Mnemopi saving session transcripts on exit when automatic retention is disabled.
- Fixed configuration writes through chained symlinks so the final target and intermediate links are preserved.
- Fixed direct tool calls using full `xd://` device URLs.
- Fixed command-backed headers in custom discovery providers being resolved for discovered models.
- Fixed Windows drive paths pasted under WSL being resolved through their `/mnt/<drive>` mounts for images and file reads.
- Improved sloppy/SPARSE edit no-match guidance so low-confidence matches are clearly presented without unsafe copy-ready operations.
- Fixed agents in Hub wait loops failing to respond to user steering messages.
- Fixed `/tan` sessions inheriting parent costs and overstating subagent totals.
- Fixed prompt action labels being truncated.
- Fixed assistant text being truncated when a tool call begins during streaming.
- Fixed the advisor dropping concerns when catching up on multiple turns and improved review context with bounded tool-result excerpts plus complete `ask` exchanges.
- Fixed bash command timeouts being delayed by child processes holding output pipes open, while improving timeout reporting and cleanup.
- Fixed retry countdowns and capped-wait errors displaying floating-point noise in millisecond durations.
- Prevented browser `app.path` from terminating existing same-executable applications when no reusable CDP endpoint is available.
- Fixed top-level errors overwriting the active composer before terminal restoration.
- Fixed Enter being ignored during the first turn when omp starts with an initial prompt.
- Fixed idle compaction discarding context while the session was still waiting on a backgrounded async job ([#10223](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10223) by [@mattwilkinsonn](https://github.com/mattwilkinsonn)).
- Fixed LSP idle timeout clobbering in multi-workspace sessions and unmanaged timer spawning on pure config reads ([#10237](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/pull/10237) by [@harshaygadekar](https://github.com/harshaygadekar)).
